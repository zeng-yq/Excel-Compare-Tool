        "question": "What is the best way to compare two Excel files for differences online?",
        "answer": "<strong>Excel Compare</strong> offers the most intuitive solution. Unlike manual checking, our tool automates the process. Simply upload your <strong>original and modified sheets</strong>, and the system will instantly identify data discrepancies. It acts as a visual &quot;diff tool&quot; specifically designed for spreadsheets, making it the <strong>best tool to compare two Excel files</strong> without complex setups."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I compare sheets side by side without extra software?",
        "answer": "You don&apos;t need to install heavy desktop software. <strong>Excel Compare</strong> runs directly in your browser. It features <strong>smart synchronized scrolling</strong>, meaning when you scroll one sheet, the other moves automatically. This allows for a perfect <strong>side-by-side comparison</strong> of rows and columns to spot changes immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this tool automatically highlight changes between Excel spreadsheets?",
        "answer": "Yes. Our engine is designed to <strong>automatically highlight changes</strong> with distinct colors. Modified cells, added rows, and deleted data are color-coded (e.g., green for additions, red for deletions). This visual approach is much faster than standard Excel formulas for finding <strong>data discrepancies</strong>."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to use free online services to compare Excel files?",
        "answer": "Most online converters upload your data to a server, which is a risk. However, <strong>Excel Compare is unique</strong>: we use <strong>client-side processing</strong> technology. Your data <strong>never leaves your computer</strong>; the comparison happens entirely within your browser. It is the most secure way to <strong>compare Excel sheets for differences</strong> online."
      },

We support files with extensive row counts, ensuring you can analyze big data efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Excel Compare completely free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, we are one of the few truly <strong>free online services to compare Excel files</strong>. There are no hidden subscription fees, no &quot;Pro&quot; versions for basic features, and no credit card required. You get full access to professional comparison features at no cost."

          "question": "Can I compare columns from two different Excel files?",
          "answer": "Yes. Native Excel requires both sheets to be in the same workbook for easy comparison. Our online tool allows you to upload two separate files (e.g., January.xlsx and February.xlsx) and compare specific columns side-by-side immediately."

          "question": "I need to match rows by ID and then compare their values (e.g., Price). Is this the right tool?",
